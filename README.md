# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from **Codeforces**, a competitive programming platform. All solutions are written in **Python** and organized by contest ID and problem category.

## Structure
Solutions organized by Contest ID (e.g., Contest_A) and Problem ID (e.g., 123A - Problem Name). Easy to navigate and reference!
